# Pmac_security
Implementation of mac algorithm with OPENMP API
We implemented the PMAC algorithm in a distributed system. We used the C language. This algorithm describes a new message authentication code. Unlike customary modes for message authentication, the construction here is fully parallelizable. This will result in a faster authen- tication in a variety of settings.
